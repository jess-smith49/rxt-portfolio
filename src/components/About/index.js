                <p>
                    I am senior at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh studying Information Systems and in the process
                    of completing my Full Stack Web Development Certificate from UW-Extended. I have been an intern at Schreiber Foods in Green Bay
                    as an IS QA Analyst since July 2020 and I am an SAP tutor at UWO. 

                    My interests in this field include web development, system analysis and desing, business analysis, and business
                    process re-engineering.

                    Now that the intro is out of the way!
                    I love to travel. I have been to Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom twice and Jamaica. Next on my list is Greece,
                    someday. I enjoy reading books of all sorts but I also love my netflix TV shows. A random fun fact about me is that 
                    I would really like to get my motorcycle licsense, though I have no interest in buying one. I recently found an interest 
                    in aerial yoga and it is on my to-do list to take some classes this year. I love finding hole in the wall bar and grills 
                    not in the city and making new friends to share experiences with.
